# Financial Planning Assignment

## Core

Welcome to the financial planning assignment completed for the Columbia FinTech Boot Camp. Within, you will find a portfolio analysis of both crytocurrencies as well as equity and bond assets. Additionally, a 30-year retirement projection has been performed for an estimate of expected returns based on previous market trends of all currently owned assets.

## Challenege

By utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation, a 5-year and 10-year retirement projection have been performed with initial investment amounts of $50,000 and $40,000 respectively. The stocks and bonds in the portfolios were the same as the original 30-year analysis with the weights of the assets within the portfolio for [SPY](https://www.nyse.com/quote/ARCX:SPY) and [AGG](https://www.nyse.com/quote/ARCX:AGG) being redistributed to 80/20 and 70/30 for SPY and AGG respectively.
